# Project Name
> Loan Default Prediction using Exploratory Data Analysis
This project aims to identify patterns and driving factors that indicate if a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan repayment. By understanding these patterns and factors, the consumer finance company can make more informed decisions regarding loan approvals, loan amounts, and interest rates, ultimately minimizing the risk of financial loss due to loan defaults.

## General Information
The consumer finance company specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When a loan application is received, the company must decide whether to approve or reject the loan based on the applicant's profile.
The business problem is to identify patterns and driving factors that indicate if a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan repayment, which can lead to financial loss for the company.
The dataset contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011, including information about past loan applicants and whether they 'defaulted' or not.

## Conclusions
The major driving factors that can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding credit loss are:
DTI (debt-to-income ratio) - A higher DTI indicates a higher likelihood of default.
Grades assigned by the lending company - Lower grades like E, F, G indicate higher risk and higher chance of default.
Verification status - Unverified applicants have a higher chance of defaulting compared to verified applicants.
Annual income - Lower annual income is associated with a higher probability of default.
Public record of bankruptcies - Applicants with public records of bankruptcies have a higher risk of defaulting.
Other important considerations for identifying potential defaults are:
Borrowers from large urban cities like California, New York, Texas, Florida, etc. tend to have a higher default rate.
Borrowers with annual income in the range of $50,000-$100,000 are more likely to default.
Borrowers with longer employment tenure (10+ years) are less likely to default.
The number of open accounts - A higher number of open accounts is associated with a lower likelihood of default.
Loan amount - Higher loan amounts are correlated with a higher likelihood of default.
Loan term - Longer loan terms are associated with a higher probability of default.
